properties:
  interrupt-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The interrupt line is asserted when at least one "key" is pressed.

  sensitivity-mode:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "low"
      - "high"
    default: "high"
    description: |
      Selects the sensitivity threshold range for touch detection.

      The sensor reports touch strength based on capacitance change relative to
      configurable thresholds. The sensitivity-level property sets a "medium"
      threshold midpoint, and the sensor reports touch strength as:

      - 0 (none): below lower bound
      - 1 (low): between lower bound and midpoint
      - 2 (medium): at or near midpoint
      - 3 (high): above midpoint toward upper bound

      This property selects between two threshold ranges:

      - "low": Narrower threshold range (requires stronger touch)
      - "high": Wider threshold range (more sensitive, default)

  sensitivity-level:
    type: int
    default: 3
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    description: |
      Sets the medium threshold midpoint (0-7). Higher values = more sensitive.

      Example thresholds (capacitance change %) for "high" mode:

        Level | Low bound | Midpoint | High bound
        ------|-----------|----------|------------
          0   |   0.40%   |   0.50%  |   0.60%
          3   |   0.95%   |   1.20%  |   1.45%
          7   |   2.85%   |   3.55%  |   4.30%

  input-codes:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      Array of input event key codes (INPUT_KEY_* or INPUT_BTN_*).

      The Si12T supports up to 12 capacitive touch channels. Each index in this
      array corresponds to a channel (0-11).
      Input events report touch strength as the value (0=none, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high).
