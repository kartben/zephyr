MikroElektronika PWM Click
==========================

Overview
********

`PWM Click`_ is a simple solution for controlling 16 PWM outputs through a single I2C interface. You
can use it to control anything from a simple LED strip to a complex robot with a multitude of moving
parts.

Requirements
************


This shield can only be used with a board that provides a mikroBUS |trade| socket and defines a
``mikrobus_i2c`` node label for the mikroBUSâ„¢ I2C interface. See :ref:`shields` for more details.

Programming
**********

Set ``-DSHIELD=mikroe_pwm_click`` when you invoke ``west build``. For example:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/sensor/sensor_shell
   :board: lpcxpresso55s16
   :shield: mikroe_pwm_click
   :goals: build

This will build the :zephyr:code-sample:`sensor_shell` sample which provides a quick way to verify
the shield is working correctly. After flashing, you can use the ``sensor`` command to list
available sensors and read their values.
