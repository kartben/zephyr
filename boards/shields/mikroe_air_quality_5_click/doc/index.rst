MikroElektronika Air Quality 5 Click
====================================

Overview
********

`Air Quality 5 Click`_ is a triple MOS sensor on a single Click board™, which can detect gas
pollution for a number of different gases. The onboard sensor is specially designed to detect the
pollution from automobile exhausts, as well as the gas pollution from the industrial or agricultural
industry. This Click board™ uses the MiCS-6814, a compact MOS sensor with three fully independent
sensing elements in one package: RED sensor, OX sensor, and NH3 sensor. Each of these sensors reacts
with the specific type of gases, providing gas readings that including carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ethanol (C2H5OH), hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4), propane
(C3H8), and isobutane (C4H10). Measurement conversion is handled by the onboard 12bit ADC converter
and it is available via the I2C interface.

Requirements
************


This shield can only be used with a board that provides a mikroBUS |trade| socket and defines a
``mikrobus_i2c`` node label for the mikroBUS™ I2C interface. See :ref:`shields` for more details.

Programming
**********

Set ``-DSHIELD=mikroe_air_quality_5_click`` when you invoke ``west build``. For example:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/sensor/sensor_shell
   :board: lpcxpresso55s16
   :shield: mikroe_air_quality_5_click
   :goals: build

This will build the :zephyr:code-sample:`sensor_shell` sample which provides a quick way to verify
the shield is working correctly. After flashing, you can use the ``sensor`` command to list
available sensors and read their values.
