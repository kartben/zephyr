Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Power Latch
===========

When running from the battery, the power button only switches the system on for as long as it is
held. The board keeps itself powered through a latch that samples ``PWR_HOLD`` (GPIO45) on a
rising edge of ``PWR_LOCK`` (GPIO46). Both lines are set high by GPIO hogs in the board devicetree,
so the system stays on once the GPIO hogs have been applied during boot. Keep the power button
pressed until then.

To switch the system off while running from the battery, drive ``PWR_HOLD`` low and generate a
rising edge on ``PWR_LOCK``. When USB power is present, the system stays powered regardless of the
latch state.

System Requirements

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

.. include:: ../../../espressif/common/building-flashing.rst
   :start-after: espressif-building-flashing

The USB Type-C connector is wired to a CH343P USB-to-UART converter, whose DTR and RTS lines drive
the ESP32-S3 reset and boot strapping pins. The ESP32-S3 built-in USB Serial/JTAG controller is not
connected, so JTAG debugging is not available.

Backup the original firmware
============================

The following command can be used to backup the original firmware:

.. code-block:: shell

   esptool -c esp32s3 -p /dev/ttyACM0 read-flash 0x0 0x2000000 fw-backup-32MB.bin
